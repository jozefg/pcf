synopsis:            A one file compiler for PCF
description:         PCF is a small programming language with higher order
                     functions, natural numbers, and recursion. It is
                     statically tpyed and turing complete (general
                     recursion and all that). This compiler transformers
                     a PCF expression into a file of C code that when run
                     outputs the answer.

                     It is mostly intended as a
                     demonstration of how to write such a compiler. The
                     curious reader should look at the <http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2015-03-24-pcf.html writeup>.
